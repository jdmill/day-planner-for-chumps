Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story
```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

```md
Displays the time on the top of the screen.
Displays time blocks for regular business hours.
Hour blocks change color depending on time.
The save button saves the information in the text area.
When the page is refreshed the text information stays
```
